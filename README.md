  I made this extension because I couldn't find a tool to let me randomly inject my own user-selected
  quotes into my email signature. I specifically wanted the quotes to be hand-selected. 
 
  Since there wasn't an existing solution, I made one.
 
  To replace the quotes with your own, edit the quotes.js file. You may use HTML markup, but be sure
  to escape your quotation marks!

  The best option for managing the quotes is to use the quote manager. On the right side of the address
  bar in your Gmail tab, click the page action icon. This pulls up a nice quote editor where you can 
  add quotes, edit quotes, and remove quotes.
  
  The JSON array importer is still available by clicking the "JSON Panel" link in the bottom left of the
  quote manager. Just be sure to save that data to a backup file, just in case, as the JSON Panel is 
  difficult to use.
